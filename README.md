# Gobuster-Gui
Gobuster is a tool designed for enumerating directories, domains, and subdomains on web targets. As it does not provide a graphical user interface, a Python-based GUI was developed to facilitate its operation, incorporating command abstractions to improve usability and execution efficiency.
